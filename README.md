CycleGAN Apple to Orange Image Translation
This project demonstrates unpaired image-to-image translation using a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN). The model is implemented from scratch using PyTorch, without relying on any pre-trained weights or external CycleGAN libraries.

Project Highlights
✅ Complete Custom Implementation: Developed the CycleGAN architecture from scratch, including custom Generator and Discriminator models in PyTorch.

✅ Unpaired Image Translation: Trained on unpaired datasets of apple and orange images, enabling bidirectional image translation.

✅ Cycle Consistency Loss: Implemented cycle-consistency loss to maintain the structural integrity of translated images.

✅ Training Pipeline: Includes data loading, model training, loss monitoring, and result visualization scripts.
